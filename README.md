Faulty Calculator
This JavaScript function simulates a calculator with a 10% chance of producing incorrect results.

How it works:

User Input: Prompts the user to enter two numbers and the desired operation (+, -, *, or /).
Error Generation: Generates a random number between 0 and 1. If the random number is less than 0.1, the function introduces an error by switching the intended operation.
Calculation: Performs the calculation based on the user input and the potential error.
Output: Displays the calculated result to the user.
To Use:

Copy and paste the faultyCalculator() function into your JavaScript environment.
Run the function.
Note:

This is a simple example for educational purposes. Real-world calculators should strive for accuracy.

I hope this description and README file are helpful!
